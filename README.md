A. Comparing the number of dives per day of the shallow profiller vs deep profiler.
  For the Axial Shallow and Deep Profiler,

 Graphing time vs. depth data would inform us how many dives each instrument went which was being run by Ocean Observatory Initiative. 
Looking at the summer graphs and winter graphs, we can see that both intrument have quite the same graphs. Going in the deeper part of the ocean gives us 2 dives nad 7 dives for going into the shallow area. This makes sense that we have more dives on deeper part since it takes longer for the experiement to get down to a depth of around 2500meters compare to only around 175meters for the shallow area.


B. Maximum values of ssp in each season? Explain why max ssp should be there?
On the Winter, maximum ssp should be in the deeper area. For the Axial Shallow, it at 75m. On the summer, the max ssp is near the surface. This is because ssp is mostly depended on the temperature of the water. The higher the temperature gets then the more speed of sound it will have. It also apply for  the testing device that in the bottom.

C. Compare the ssp profile in day and night of all profilers, explain what you find (Effect of day vs. night)


Comparing the ssp profile to day and night graph of an intrument in a greater depth, it should have no effect mostly because the temperature doesn't change as much in deep underwater. Normally, if the temperature on the depth where optimize speed of sound changed, then we see a great difference on the speed of sound betweeen day and night. From the formula for speed of sound, The greatest factor is the temperature and if that doesn't change (which is our case in deep underwater) as much then "spp" would still remain the same. The more warmer the water gets then the higher the speed of sound it has.


D. Compare the ssp profile in summer and winter of all profilers, explain what you find (Effect of season).

From the graphs, we can see that the season doesnt affect the speed of sound for the deep part of the ocean. During the summer where temperature is higher, speed of sound should be greater. However, our data doesn't prove it. One reason could be that in Oregon, temperature in deep area doesn't change as much. As a consequence, speed of sound wouldn't change as much as well. 

Foor the different season of the shallow area, we can see that the highest speed of sound in the summer occur at a more shallow depth of (25m for Axial Base profiler) and 75m for for winter. This make sense since in the summer, the closest to the surface you are, the highest temperature it will have. meaning, speed of sound should occur at a shallow depth when its hot.

E. Compare the average ssp profiles of all profilers recorded at the same day in winter and summer (Effect of location).

As I have mentioned from part d, winter season doesnt affect the average ssp that much in the deeper part of the ocean season the winter and summer aren't that extreme to reach the deeper area. However, for the Shallow one it getting affected by how the highest speed of sound occur in a more shallow area due to the hot temperature of water. We know that temperature is the greatest factor that affect the speed of sound.
