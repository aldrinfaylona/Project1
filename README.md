A. Comparing the number of dives per day of the shallow profiller vs deep profiler.
  For the Axial Shallow and Deep Profiler,

 Graphing time vs. depth data would inform us how many dives each instrument went which was being run by Ocean Observatory Initiative. 
Looking at the summer graphs and winter graphs, we can see that both intrument have quite the same graphs. Going in the deeper part of the ocean gives us 2 dives nad 7 dives for going into the shallow area. This makes sense that we have more dives on deeper part since it takes longer for the experiement to get down to a depth of around 2500meters compare to only around 175meters for the shallow area.


B. Maximum values of ssp in each season? Explain why max ssp should be there?

C. Compare the ssp profile in day and night of all profilers, explain what you find (Effect of day vs. night)


Comparing the ssp profile to day and night graph of an intrument in a greater depth, it should have no effect mostly because the temperature doesn't change as much in deep underwater. Normally, if the temperature on the depth where optimize speed of sound changed, then we see a great difference on the speed of sound betweeen day and night. From the formula for speed of sound, The greatest factor is the temperature and if that doesn't change (which is our case in deep underwater) as much then "spp" would still remain the same. The more warmer the water gets then the higher the speed of sound it has.


D. Compare the ssp profile in summer and winter of all profilers, explain what you find (Effect of season).

From the graphs, we can see that the season doesnt affect the speed of sound at the area. During the summer, in which temperature is higher, speed of sound should be greater. However, our data doesn't prove it. One reason could be that in Oregon, temperature in deep area doesn't change as much. As a consequence, temperature is also no changing as much. Most likely in other places where temperature of the ocean gets extremely hot and then cold in the winter, would show a much better result.

E. Compare the average ssp profiles of all profilers recorded at the same day in winter and summer (Effect of location).

For the deep location, the highest speed of sound is 1500 with a depth of 2600 while the shallow location shows a higher speed of sound of 1520 at 10meters. We can see that the Speed of sound on the shallow area goes much higher than
