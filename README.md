A. Comparing the number of dives per day of the shallow profiller vs deep profiler.
  For the Oregon Offshore Cabled Shallow and Deep Profiler Mooring,

 Graphing time vs. depth data would inform us how many dives each instrument went which was being run by Ocean Observatory Initiative. 
Looking at the summer graphs and winter graphs, we can see that both intrument have quite the same graphs. Going in the deeper part of the ocean gives us 2 dives nad 7 dives for going into the shallow area. This makes sense that we have more dives on deeper part since it takes longer for the experiement to get down to a depth of around 2500meters compare to only around 175meters for the shallow area.

B. Maximum values of ssp in each season? Explain why max ssp should be there?





C. Compare the ssp profile in day and night of all profilers, explain what you find (Effect of day vs. night)


Comparing the ssp profile to day and night graph, we can see that it has no effect mostly because the temperature doesn't change as much in deep underwater. Normally, if the temperature on the depth where optimize speed of sound changed, then we see a great difference on the speed of sound betweeen day and night. From the formula for speed of sound, The greatest factor is the temperature and if that doesn't change (which is our case in deep underwater) as much then "spp" would still remain the same. The more colder the water gets the faster the speed of sound has since it is more dense and atoms are more compact and easier for sound to travel. 


D. Compare the ssp profile in summer and winter of all profilers, explain what you find (Effect of season).



E. Compare the average ssp profiles of all profilers recorded at the same day in winter and summer (Effect of location).
